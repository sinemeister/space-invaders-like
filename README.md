## Instructions

On some predefined occasions, power ups come down to enable users' mega laser beam to kill all the aliens on the screen. In case that player is short of lives, hearts come down as well. It has no effect if the player has full lives, which is 5.

Should user wants to pause or restart the game, they are allowed to do so with ESC and R, respectively. If user wants to read the instructions in the help window, they can press F1 while playing, and pick the game up from where they left off with the same key. Should user wants to return to start menu, they can press DEL key.

## More

This project is developed solely by myself as an educational project as I have started programming just about a month ago. I have no commercial or monetary intentions. I used royalty-free images which can be easily found across the Internet. I used sound effects from Pixabay which are also royalty-free.

New features are planned to be added on the game in the coming days as I develop myself further. I also plan to tidy the code up.
